## Copyright Notice

The containing license file (`LICENSE`) and especially the license itself is momentarily **not** appropriate for the file `ip_in_range.php` and its contents. As mentioned in the [comments](https://github.com/biolauri/git-php-deploy/commit/a0d78ca194485ec1bdb31c907e1a13d98e15506a#commitcomment-13058312) on the [commit](https://github.com/biolauri/git-php-deploy/commit/a0d78ca194485ec1bdb31c907e1a13d98e15506a), it is forked from [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/tott/7684443) from GitHub user [@tott](https://github.com/tott).  
Apparently, he didn't upload a license file with it. According to [GitHubs Terms of Services](https://github.com/site/terms), only forking is allowed, so redistributing or relicensing is prohibited.

Issue [#1](../../issues/1) tries to fix this. Once it is closed, this notice will be removed.
